It might look like you’re just standing there, but Mountain Pose — 
Tadasana (tah-DAHS-uh-nuh) — is an active pose that helps improve 
posture, balance, and calm focus. Its name comes from the Sanskrit 
words "tada" (meaning "mountain") and "asana" (meaning "pose"). 
Tadasana is the foundational pose for all standing yoga postures and 
full inversions, such as Handstand and Headstand. It is the pose from 
which every other standing pose in your practice is born! The alignment, 
muscle movements, and mindset you learn in Tadasana are applied every 
time you do a standing yoga pose. So, it’s important to learn how to do 
it correctly. Once you understand the proper form of Mountain Pose, it 
will be easier to gain and maintain the alignment for all other standing 
poses and inversions.

Benefits of Mountain Pose
A correctly executed Tadasana will use every muscle in the body. It 
improves posture and, when practiced regularly, can help reduce back pain. 
This pose strengthens the thighs, knees, ankles, abdomen, and buttocks. It is 
also helpful for relieving sciatica and for reducing the affects of flat feet.
Breathe and all will be revealed; love and all will be healed. This is yoga.
Seane Corn
Tadasana steadies the mind and body, bringing a calm focus to the practitioner. 
Practicing the pose with steady and smooth breath will help relieve stress and 
improve concentration.
Cautions
Due to the balancing nature of the posture, do not practice Mountain Pose if 
you are currently experiencing headaches, insomnia, low blood pressure, or if
you are lightheaded and/or dizzy. Always work within your own range of limits 
and abilities. If you have any medical concerns, talk with your doctor before 
practicing yoga.
