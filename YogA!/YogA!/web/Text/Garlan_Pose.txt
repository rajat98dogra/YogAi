Hip flexibility is a common issue for many people today. Sitting for long periods 
can shorten and tighten the inner thighs, groin, and hip flexors — which can cause 
poor posture and back pain. Garland Pose is a hip-opening yoga posture that helps 
to lengthen and open the hips, creating more mobility for all of your daily activities.

The Sanskrit name for this pose, "Malasana" (mah-LAHS-uh-nuh) comes from two words:

"Mala" — meaning "garland"
"Asana" — meaning "pose"
Sometimes also called, "Wide Squat," Malasana is the preparatory position for the arm 
balance, "Crow Pose" (Bakasana). Some yoga teachers also refer to Malasana as "Frog 
Pose," but that is not to be confused with the hip-opening pose performed on the knees, 
which is also called "Frog Pose."

Garlands for Inner Peace
In India, garlands of flowers or beads are often used as ritual offerings and altar decoration. 
Mala beads, also known as prayer beads, are traditionally used to assist with meditation. 
Hip-opening yoga poses like Malasana are traditionally used to help prepare the body for 
long periods of seated meditation. Practicing Malasana can help you connect with ancient 
rituals of yoga, which can lead you deeper into your own meditation practice.

Benefits of Garland Pose
Malasana stretches the thighs, groin, hips, ankles, and torso. It tones the abdominal muscles 
and improves the function of the colon to help with elimination. This pose also increases 
circulation and blood flow in the pelvis, which can help regulate sexual energy. Malasana 
improves balance, concentration, and focus. Malasana is particularly beneficial for women 
who are pregnant, as it can later aid in childbirth.
